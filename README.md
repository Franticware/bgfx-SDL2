# bgfx-SDL2

A simple example of using bgfx in SDL2 that actually draws something.

It uses glm transformations instead of built-in bgfx ones. Due to differences in coordinate systems, the scene is flipped horizontally.

Derived from bgfx examples.

Tested in x64 Linux on RX 460 with Vulkan and OpenGL. It should work in Windows as well.
